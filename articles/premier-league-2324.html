            <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">Sometimes, a substitute can change the match. I wanted to see the repartition of goals scored by starters and substitutes. 
              Also, I wanted to see this repartition within teams, and see <b>which team has more goals scored by substitutes</b>, and inversely:</p>

          <p>
            <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Newcastle Utd</b></span> is the team with the most goals scored by subs, with a total of <span style="color:#f54842"><b>14 goals</b></span>, which represent more than <b>16%</b> of their goals scored. 
            <br>The team with the fewest substitutes scoring a goal is <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>West Ham</b></span>, with only <span style="color:#f54842"><b>3 goals</b></span>.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">A goal can be scored in <b>several scenarios</b>: during the course of play, a free kick or a corner. 
              <br>Let's see the breakdown of all the goals scored:</p>
          </div>
          <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

            </a>
          </div>
          <p>
            Logically, the most goals were scored <b>during the game</b>, with more than <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>80% of all scored goals</b></span>. 
            <br>However, we note that <span style="color:#f54842"><b>95 goals</b></span> were scored from <b>penalties</b>, which is not far from all the other goals scored from set pieces, excluding free kicks and penalty kicks (<b>131 goals</b>).
            <br>We will see the team distribution of these types of goals a little later.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most prolific gameweek ü§ë</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">Every weekend, we had the chance to experience memorable matches. But let's see <b>which gameweek had the most goals scored</b>:</p>
          </div>

          </div>
          <p>
            With <span style="color:#f54842"><b>45 goals</b></span>, the most prolific gameweek is <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Gameweek 23</b></span>.
            <br>It happened at the beginning of February, and we can remember a few results: 
            <li>The <b>4-4</b> draw between Newcastle and Luton</li>
            <li>The <b>5-0</b> win by Aston Villa at Sheffield Utd</li>
            <li>The Arsenal clash against Liverpool, ending in a <b>3-1</b> victory for the Gunners. Knowing how the season ended, this victory for Arsenal made a huge difference!</li>
            <br>We can see that the average goals scored each gameweek is approximatively <span style="color:#f54842"><b>33 goals</b></span>, which is one of the <b>highest average in top 5 leagues in Europe</b>.

            With <span style="color:#f54842"><b>27 goals</b></span>, <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Erling Haaland</b></span> is the owner of this title, with an average <b>PSxG* of 0,68</b>. 
            <br><b>*PSxG</b>: <i>The weaker PSxG is, the more unexpected and therefore beautiful the goals. On the contrary, the closer PSxG is to 1, the 'easier' the goals are to score.</i> 
            <br><br>Just right behind him, we have <span style="color:#4287f5">Cole Palmer</span> with <b>22 goals</b> and <span style="color:#4287f5">Alexander Isak</span> with <b>21 goals</b>. 
            <br>The English and Swedish football teams' attack have a bright future ahead of them with these two players!
            <br><br>Concercing assists, the best player with <span style="color:#f54842"><b>13 assists</b></span> is <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Ollie Watkins</b></span>. 
            We must not forget that he is the striker and also the <b>best scorer of his team</b>, which is such a great performance to be at this position for him. He was even named playmaker of the season! üëè

              <li>The other criterion concerns <b>altruism efficiency</b>, in particular the player's ability to provide a good pass that can end up being decisive. This is done in the same way as the other criterion, by taking the difference between the number of assists made and the number of expected assists.</li>
              <ul>

            <br>Also, he has the best saves percentage ([shots on target against - goals against]/shots on target against) in the league, with <b>80.8% of saves</b>.
            <br><br>Logically, the top goalkeepers are from <b>teams that conceded a lot of goals</b>, like Sheffield Utd, Luton Town or Burnley. 
            <br>On the other hand, the 3 last goalkeepers are from the 2 best teams in the league, i.e. Arsenal and Manchester City.

                    <li>Thus, a team with a positive result scores more often than expected.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>The other criterion concerns <b>defensive efficiency</b>. This is done in the same way as the other criterion, by taking the difference between the number of goals conceded and the number of expected goals conceded.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Thus, a team with a negative result concede less goals than expected.</li>

            <h2>Thank you for reading !</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -20px;">It's been such an exciting Premier League season! This was a great opportunity for me to mix both of my passion, football and data analysis, and to challege myself with a long-term project. 
              I really enjoyed <b>gathering data</b> from my various sources <i>(<a href="https://fbref.com/en/comps/1/schedule/World-Cup-Scores-and-Fixtures" target="_blank">fbref.com</a> and <a href="https://www.premierinjuries.com/injury-table.php" target="_blank">Premier Injuries</a></i>), <b>creating my data</b> files, <b>exploring</b> it, creating <b>vizualisation</b> to be easier for you to read and memorize, and finally <b>writing</b> and <b>coding</b> this article. 
              <br>If you have any suggestion about other subjects that I am passionate about to do a project about it, <b>feel free to contact me</b>!
              <br>You can check the notebook where I did all the data analysis right <a href="https://github.com/kevinnclas/2023-2024-PremierLeague-DataAnalysis/blob/main/script_analysis.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.
              <br>If you are interested about day-by-day prediction depending on injured players, previous results and difficulty index depending the opponent, you can check my notebook <a href="https://github.com/kevinnclas/2023-2024-PremierLeague-DataAnalysis/blob/main/script_prediction.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.
              <br>Thank you very much for reading me and my work, I tried to do my best to deliver the best data and analysis possible.
