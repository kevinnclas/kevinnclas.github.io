          <br>With an incredible competition, we will see him again later...</p>

          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Best assists 🥇</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">We also want to know who made the <b>most assists</b> in this World Cup:</p>

        <p>
          As for the assists, we have <b>5 players</b> <i>(Bruno Fernandes, Harry Kane, Antoine Griezmann, Ivan Perišić and Lionel Messi)</i> that made <b>3 assists</b> in the competition. 
          <br>Honorable mention goes to <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Bruno Fernandes</b></span> who made <span style="color:#f54842"><b>3 assists</b></span> in the least number of matches played, only <b>4</b>.
        </p>

          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most decisive player 💪</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">If we combine <b>goals & assists</b>, we can go a bit further and see who was the most <b>decisive player</b> of the competition:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="../assets/img/articles/2022_fifa_world_cup/most decisive player.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="80%" data-aos="fade" style="border-radius: 5px;">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          If we only focus on the total of goals and assists, <b>Kylian Mbappé</b> and <b>Lionel Messi</b> are tied to a score of <b>10</b>, with an advantage to the French phenomenon who scored <span style="color:#f54842"><b>8 goals</b></span> versus <b>7 goals</b> for the Argentinian magician.  
          <br>But, if we go deeper and watch <b>Goals + Assists - Goals scored on Penalty Kicks made per 90 minutes</b>, we can see that <b>Kylian Mbappé</b> is more decisive, with a score of <span style="color:#f54842"><b>1,2</b></span> versus <span style="color:#4287f5">0,78</span> for Messi.  
          <br>So we can conclude that <span style="color: #2a19ae;"><b>Kylian Mbappé</b></span>, in addition of being the <b>top scorer of the competition</b>, is also the <b>most decisive player</b> of the competition. What a journey for the 24 years old player!

          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Youngest & oldest players 👶👴</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">During the World Cup, we often have some players that are experimented, others less. Let's see who are the <b>youngest</b> and the <b>oldest</b> player of the competition:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          For the youngest players, we have <b>4 players</b> <i>(Gavi, Jewison Bennette, Garang Kuol and Youssoufa Moukoko)</i> that only had <b>17 years old</b> during the competition. Also, they all played at least one match.  
          <br>I wanted to highlight <span style="color: #2a19ae;"><b>Gavi</b></span> that made an incredible appearance for his age, who started <b>4 matches</b> with Spain and even scored <span style="color:#f54842"><b>1 goal</b></span>.
          <br><br>For the oldest players, we have <b>5 players</b> <i>(Pepe, Atiba Hutchinson, Dani Alves, Eiji Kawashima)</i> aged <b>39 years old</b>. At this age, to still be at this level of performance, is already remarkable. Among those players, <b>3 of them</b> were able to play at least one match during this World Cup.  
          <br>The honorable mention is attributed to <span style="color: #2a19ae;"><b>Pepe</b></span>, who scored <span style="color:#f54842"><b>1 goal</b></span> for Portugal and who played <b>4 matches and 360 minutes</b> at 39.
        </p>
      </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most effective player 🎯</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">Now, let's see who was the <b>most effective</b> or <b>surprising</b> player of the tournament, <b>i.e. (Goals + Assits) - (Expected Goals + Expected Assists)</b>:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

        <p>
          Once again, <span style="color: #2a19ae;"><b>Kylian Mbappé</b></span>, with an effectiveness score of <b>3.5</b>, i.e. <span style="color:#f54842"><b>3,5 times more decisive than expected</b></span>, is the leader of this metric.

      <div class="container">

          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most disappointing player ☹️</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">On the other hand, we can have the <b>most disappointing player</b> of the competition, which is attributed to the player who was expected to score or make an assist but did not do so the most times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

          Unfortunately, this title is assigned to <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Lautaro Martínez</b></span>, who played <b>6 matches</b> and <b>241 minutes</b> but didn't score or made any assist during his games... He was expected to be <span style="color:#f54842">1,9 times more decisive that he actually was</span>.
        </p>

      <div class="container">

          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Super Sub of the competition 🦹</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">The title of "Super Sub" is given to the player who has replaced another during a match, and who <b>has scored or made an assist after coming in the most times</b>.</p>

          <br>Those players are <b>Niclas Füllkrug</b> for Germany and <b>Álvaro Morata</b> for Spain. An honorable mention for <span style="color: #2a19ae"><b>Niclas Füllkrug</b></span>, who only played <b>3 matches</b>, one less than Morata.

          If we are looking the number of wins, we can see that the two finalists, <b>France and Argentina</b>, are logically on top on the ranking.  
          <br>But with <span style="color:#f54842"><b>5 wins</b></span> (wins before a penalty shootout), <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>France</b></span> is the nation that won the most games. 
          <br>With a great journey in this competition, it's sad for France not to have won this World Cup. In fact, they only lost 1 game against <span style="color:#4287f5">Tunisia</span> (nation that we will see later), and draw against <span style="color:#4287f5">Argentina</span>, the World Cup Champion.
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I thought it could be also interesting to know which continent <b>won the most matches</b>. In the following graph, there are the number of wins per continent:</p>

          Ranked by the number of <b>goals</b> scored, then by number of <b>shots on target</b> and finaly by number of <b>shots</b>, the <b>most offensive team</b> of this World Cup is <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>France</b></span>, with <span style="color:#f54842"><b>16 goals</b></span>, <span style="color:#f54842"><b>33 shots on target</b></span> and <span style="color:#f54842"><b>100 shots</b></span>.
          <br>But if we sort by the number of shots on target first, <span style="color:#4287f5">Argentina</span> is first, with <b>15 goals</b> for 41 shots on target. It is normal to find the <b>two finalists</b> of the competition as the two most offensive teams.

      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most defensive team 💎</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">To determine which team had the <b>best defense</b>, I took into account the number of <b>goals conceded</b>, the number of <b>shots on target conceded</b> and the number of <b>shots conceded</b>. After that, I <b>normalized per match played for each team</b>. 
            <br><br>I sorted the results first by the number of normalized goals taken, then the number of games played, then the number of normalized shots conceded and finally the number of normalized shots conceded.
            <br><br><u>Let me explain why I chose this order for the ranking of the defensiveness of the teams:</u>
            <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
              <li>The first is the <b>number of goals conceded</b> in ascending order: it's the most obvious indicator, because if a team has a great defense, it doesn't take goals.</li>
              <li>Second is the <b>number of match played</b> in descending order: the more you played games and the least you took goals, the better your defense was.</li>
              <li>Then, the <b>number of shots on target conceded</b> in descending order: if you take a lot of shots on target but don't take many goals, it means you have a great goalkeeper and he is the last bastion of your team.</li>
              <li>Finally, the <b>number of shots conceded</b> in ascending order: I assumed that the least shots conceded, the better defensive pressure was applied to prevent a shot from the other team.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">
            At the end, we have this result:
          </p>

          So, with my ranking method used, we have <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>Tunisia</b></span> as the <b>best defensive team</b> of the tournament (<span style="color:#f54842"><b>1 goal conceded, 10 shots on target and 30 shots conceded</b></span> in <b>3 matches played</b>).  
          <br>I <b>normalized</b> the data to get closer to reality, because <b>the teams didn't played the same amount of games</b>. But this technique of normalization is <b>not really the best way to approach a true reality</b>. In fact, the gap of games played on which we made the normalization is <b>not big enough</b> to have an effective normalization and a good representation of reality.  
          <br>If we look only the final four nations <i>(Morocco, Croatia, Argentina and France)</i>, <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>Morocco</b></span> has the best defense of the tournament, with <span style="color:#f54842"><b>5 goals conceded, 14 shots on target and 71 shots conceded</b></span> in <b>7 matches played</b>.

          <br>Looking at Germany's convertness score, we can see that only <span style="color:#f54842"><b>26,09%</b></span> of Germany's shots on target were converted into goals.

            <br>We can start by looking at the <b>number of goals</b> for each World Cup's edition since 1998:</p>

          <h2>Going Further</h2>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">During this 2022 edition, I noticed some specificities according to the <b>form and tiredness</b> of the players. In fact, this World Cup happened in the middle of a regular season, unlike the previous editions. Let's discuss of these metrics:</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Average of additional time ⏱️</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">If you watched some matches during the World Cup, you probably noticed that there was a lot of additional time added, unlike in the regular season. 
            <br>This happened because the FIFA's objective was to increase effective playing time. See the <b>average of additional time</b> on all the competition:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="../assets/img/articles/2022_fifa_world_cup/additionnal time.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="80%" data-aos="fade" style="border-radius: 5px;">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          On average on this World Cup, there was more than <span style="color:#f54842"><b>10 minutes</b></span> of additional time by match. In total, that was <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>650 minutes</b></span> played in additional time in <b>64 matches played</b>.
          <br>The maximum additional time during a half of a match was <span style="color:#4287f5"><b>14 minutes</b></span>. It happened during the first half of <b>England - IR Iran</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Rate of injured players among substitutes 🩺</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">During this competition, we saw a lot of injured players, maybe because the fatigue accumulated during the first part of the regular season. I wanted to see the <b>rate of players being replaced due to injury compared to the overall number of players being replaced</b> on all the competition:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="../assets/img/articles/2022_fifa_world_cup/injuries.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="80%" data-aos="fade" style="border-radius: 5px;">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          During the 64 matches, there were <b>587 substitutes</b> made by the coaches. Among them, <span style="color:#f54842"><b>38 substitutes</b></span> were made because a player was <b>injured</b> and not able to play anymore. As a result, <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>6,47%</b></span> of all players being substituted were injured.
          <br>Maybe it's because the <b>players are more tired</b> and <b>easily injured</b>, after a first part of the regular season.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-title">
          <h3 style="color: #2a19ae;">Most prolific half ⚽️</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: -15px;">To finish my analysis, I wanted to see which half of a match was the <b>most profilic in terms of average goals scored</b>, and see if there was any difference:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="../assets/img/articles/2022_fifa_world_cup/most prolific half.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="80%" data-aos="fade" style="border-radius: 5px;">

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px;">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          As we can see, <span style="color:#f54842"><b>0,52 goal</b></span> was scored during the <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>1<sup>st</sup> half</b></span>. As for the <span style="color:#2a19ae"><b>2<sup>nd</sup> half</b></span>, it's <span style="color:#f54842"><b>0,8 goal</b></span> that was scored.
          <br>Maybe it's because the teams are not enough confortable in the 1<sup>st</sup> half to be too much attacking, and matches tend to be more released at the end of the match to try to win.
